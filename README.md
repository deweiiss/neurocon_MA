## Starting the Application
When trying to open the application after downloading the artifacts from Github it can be that your local machine
does not trust the application.

#### MacOS
For MacOS this command can be used to bypass the local gatekeeper.
```
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine path/to/your/tauri/directory
```
Aftter this you can add the app to your "Applications" directory and open it from there.
